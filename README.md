# DF React Components

**A collection of React components created by Dean Forant.**


## Skillbar

The skillbar component was created when I was looking for a good percentage bar that could represent the level of experience I have in a single skill on my portfolio page. After trying several components that were available via codepen, Github etc... I came to the conclusion that I didn't really like any of them.

For now I will keep the skill bar simple. base the width of the bar will be based on a scale of 1-10.


#### **Enhancements to be added in future releases:**

* Come up with a way to create one div that will adjust the width based off of a percentage number. Initial attempts to do this created some weird behaivior with the Tailwind styling.
